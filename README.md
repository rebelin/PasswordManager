This program helps with password management. The password needs to be 8 characters long, contais an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and symbol. If prompted, this program can generate a random password that meets all criteria (with at least 90 in strength). Password strength is roughly calculated by poor version of bit-based information entropy. The password can be encrypted using the Vigenere Cipher and returned.
